<p> Provides classes and interfaces to facilitate all aspects of testing including 
    unit tests, performance, regression, etc.</p>
    
<p> Too often unit tests focus on one aspect: "Validation". But although a code 
    modification might not break your application; it may very well impact the 
    performance significantly (for the better or the worst). 
    External elements (JVM, O/S, memory available, runtime options) are also likely to affect 
    performance.  It is therefore important to not only be able to measure the 
    performance but also to detect automatically (regression tests) when any change
    you make in your code or runtime environment breaks your timing assumptions.</p>
    
<p> This test framework addresses not only the validation aspect of testing but 
    performance and regression as well.</p>
    
<p> In a normal situation, the developer creates a 
    {@link javolution.testing.TestSuite TestSuite} which is basically
    a collection of {@link javolution.testing.TestCase TestCase} logically grouped 
    together.
    <i>(Note: You will find examples of test suites in the <code>javolution.*</code> source directory)</i>.
    Then by running within an appropriate {@link javolution.testing.TestContext TestContext}, the developer 
    can focus on any particular aspect of interest (behavior, performance, memory usage, ...) 
    [code]
    // Default context (validation).
    TextContext.enter();
    try {
        TestContext.run(myTestSuite);
        TestContext.run(myTestSuite.tests().get(3)); // Runs individual test case.
        ...
    } finally {
        TestContext.exit(); // Prints test result statistics.
    }

    // Time context (measures execution time)
    TimeContext.enter();
    try {
        TestContext.run(myTestSuite);
        ...
    } finally {
        TimeContext.exit();
    }
    
    // Regression tests (no output, AssertionException raised if any test fails).
    TestContext.enter(TestContext.REGRESSION); // Or TimeContext.REGRESSION for performance based regression.
    try {
        TestContext.run(myTestSuite);
        ...
    } finally {
        TestContext.exit();
    }
    [/code]
    
    Logging/tests contexts do not have to output test results in a text form.
    Implementations may store results in databases, spreadsheets or show them graphically (IDE plugin).
    [code]
    // Logs output to console.
    TestContext.enter(TestContext.CONSOLE);
    try {
        TestContext.run(myTestSuite);
        ...
    } finally {
        TestContext.exit();
    }[/code] </p>
